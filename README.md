# Simple Implementations of common sorting algorithms in C.
 Just for kicks.

 **Algorithms**:
- Insertion sort.
- Selection sort.
- Merge sort.
- Bubble sort.
- Quick sort (with and without tail call optimization.)
- Introsort (an efficient combination of heapsort, insertion sort and quicksort)
- Shell sort
- Heap sort
- Radix sort
- Counting sort
- Bucket sort

Comparison also done with inbuilt qsort.
